        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Here is a recipe to make authentic sushi rice from scratch. 
            It is suggested to use white calrose (sticky) rice. You are
            welcome to adjust the vinegar and sugar ratios to taste.
            Some people find that there is usually too much vinegar
            or too much sugar, so it is okay to adjust according
            to your needs and preferences. </p>
        
        <p>Do not let sushi rice stay in the refrigerator too long
            as the rice is prone to get hard after a night in the
            refrigerator.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups white rice</li>
            <li>1 cup rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the rice according to package instructions. Let
                cool.
            </li>
            <li>Prepare the sushi rice dressing by heating a pot 
                on the stove and mixing in the vinegar, white sugar,
                and oil together. Allow the mixture to blend and then
                pull it off the stove to cool.
            </li>
            <li>Mix the liquid into the rice. It will appear
                very wet at first but let it cool for a bit. 
            </li>
            <li>Use for poke bowls or sushi! Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
