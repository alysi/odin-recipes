        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Now here's what you should bring to a party: the 
            ultimate crowd-pleasing comfort food, potato salad!
            Enjoy chopped potatoes, eggs, pimento, and more in 
            this island-style version of an American favorite. </p>
        
        <p>When preparing potatoes, make sure they are soft before
            cutting into them. I suggest red potatoes peeled for the
            best results!
